# Changelog
* Redesigned and added default timers (just for English need localizers)  
* Slightly changed interface and design for small things
Based on `Advanced Timers 3.43`

# Instalation
Put `Timers` folder to `World of Warcraft\Interface\AddOns`

# Known bugs
* On the triggers tab (and their settings) is badly displayed inside the chatbox. But it works fine, just display problem.
* `/showtime` command does not work for RENDcd

# Detailed description
* The addon is configured to work "from the box", (no announce in raidchat and guildchat), so it can be easily changed in a few clicks if you want.
* Timers can be not accurate, so report me bugs.
* Also, I'm looking for information about all rare elites respawn times. (Yes, I know that many of the spreading of the minimum and maximum time, I need both.)
